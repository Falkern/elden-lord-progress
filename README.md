# Elden Lord Progress ðŸ‘‘

This is an app where you can upload your **ELDEN RING** save files to check your progress throughout the game.

## Features

- **Upload your save file**: Easily upload your ELDEN RING save file to track your progress.
- **User-friendly interface**: Designed with simplicity in mind using Vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

## Motivation

Just thought of going back to **vanilla JS** and **plain CSS** and **HTML** for a bit to change things up since I have just being using Typescript and VueJS.

## How to Use

- Visit the vercel deployed site.
